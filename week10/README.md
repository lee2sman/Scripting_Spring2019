# Week 10
 
# Class:
- Hello
- Show-N-Tell (5 share x 5 minutes feedback x 7 groups)
- Brainstorm Server Session
- Studio Time and 1-on-1 check-ins with groups

# Technical Longevity and the Web!

Problems:
- link rot
- techincal changes in Javascript, HTML and CSS (to a lesser degree)
- autoplaying
- security restrictions
- Device changes (audio, watches, fonts, etc)

Trigger loading new html page after date.

Do not use CDNs. Host Javascript libraries and stylesheets, images and fonts locally.

Include images of screenshots and video capture as documentation.

# Homework:

1. Following feedback on your groups second round of show-n-tell, collaboratively reflect on what was said/brought up. As a group, what do you agree with and how are you going to take action to address the feedback and concerns? Just as you did last week, the articulation, research, scope, and/or manifestation of your project should adapt. Again, this should be done in the spirit of discussion in a collaborative space where your process is recorded and can be shared.

2. Taking action on the above and actualize the work. For 04/10, you should have a final functioning website, with all actualized copy/interactions/etc… ready to share for a final “proof” review.

This should show your group's final, refined, visual voice (color, interfaces, type styles, image treatment, tone of language, etc...), leverage of interaction/engagement possible in digital space, and a logical strategy related to looking nice today as well as being accessible in 10 years.

Please be prepared to kick off this review of the work with a collaboratively written 1 paragraph statement on the work which addresses your thematic, strategies, reasoning, and thoughts on making the work accessible in 10 years.

3. Remember, at any point over break, you should feel more than able to email both of us
for feedback!
