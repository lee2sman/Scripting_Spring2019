# Week 10
 
# Class:
- Hello
- Show-N-Tell (5 share x 5 minutes feedback x 7 groups)
- Brainstorm Server Session
- Studio Time and 1-on-1 check-ins with groups

# Technical Longevity and the Web!

Problems:
- link rot
- technical changes in Javascript, HTML and CSS (to a lesser degree)
- browser support and legacy in the future (old Javascript, APIs, Java, etc)
- autoplaying media (will no longer work)
- security restrictions (camera)
- Device changes (audio, watches, fonts, etc) - what will a screen look like in the future?
- responsive design!
- network architecture changes to protocols (result of loss of net neutrality?)

### Time Capsule Reveal Method
- How do you trigger loading new html page after date?

### Legacy/Documentation

Do not use CDNs. Self-host Javascript libraries and stylesheets, images and fonts locally.

Include page text, images of screenshots and (possibly) video capture as documentation.

Accessibility as legacy. Alternative text description of images and links using ```alt```. 

```
<img src="whatever.jpg" alt="A group of people sitting in front of a clock">
```

### Server options

1. Linode server
2. Raspberry Pi server self-hosted on campus

We will hold a workshop on these April 10, 2019.

## Set the time capsule to open (be revealed) on

# Homework:

1. Following feedback on your groups second round of show-n-tell, collaboratively reflect on what was said/brought up. As a group, what do you agree with and how are you going to take action to address the feedback and concerns? Just as you did last week, the articulation, research, scope, and/or manifestation of your project should adapt. Again, this should be done in the spirit of discussion in a collaborative space where your process is recorded and can be shared.

2. Taking action on the above and actualize the work. For 04/10, you should have a final functioning website, with all actualized copy/interactions/etc… ready to share for a final “proof” review.

This should show your group's final, refined, visual voice (color, interfaces, type styles, image treatment, tone of language, etc...), leverage of interaction/engagement possible in digital space, and a logical strategy related to looking nice today as well as being accessible in 10 years.

Please be prepared to kick off this review of the work with a collaboratively written 1 paragraph statement on the work which addresses your thematic, strategies, reasoning, and thoughts on making the work accessible in 10 years.

3. Remember, at any point over break, you should feel more than able to email both of us
for feedback!
