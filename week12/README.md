# Presentations

For feedback, remember this work should show a final, refined visual voice, leverage interaction/engagement possibilities,  have a clearly articulated curatorial/artist statement on the works "aboutness", and have a clearly articulated logical strategy related to ideas of accessibility/legacy.

Aim to address these major facets in your feedback to your peers, as well as when sharing your own studios work!

This is a time for feedback from other studios. Lee & Kelsey will email formal feedback to each studio in addition to this peer proof review.

# Homework

1. Over the next week, as a group you will take action on issues/opportunities addressed in the proof review today. Where were the missed opportunities or ones that were not seen? This includes both formal things (how it looks, craft of code), as well as conceptual things (how you articulate the work, and the underlying strategies of it)

As you have done priorly, discuss what was said in a documented way, and take action on these facets. As a group, you will refine this "proof" to a final mechanical for submission next week. 

2. As a group, write a 1-2 paragraph statement on the work and upload it to a shared space (or comment it within the code...). Consider this a concise curatorial/artist statement on the works "aboutness", which includes a statement related to your studios ideas of accessibility/legacy within the work.

3. Submit this final work for our capsule(s) by submitting to Github and ensuring both Kelsey & Lee have access/link to this by noon on Wednesday April 17.
