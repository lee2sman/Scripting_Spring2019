# Final Project

This semester we have built websites for our class, (false) or misleading institutional websites, and a web-based time capsule. These sites have been collections of material: images, galleries, or institutional pages with lots of choices of what to navigate. They give a user multiple modes of entry and allow exploration. Now we are going to go small and concentrate on creating a site, app or extension for a single project or idea that we want to deliver to the world that will be delivered as a speculative work.

We have had multiple discussions on contemporary issues relating to the web today, from companies tracking users' every action, to the loss of privacy and the inability of many users to resist the compulsion to check their various feeds. How can you acknowledge this world and create a new intimacy with your website's visitors?

For this assignment you will make a mobile-responsive site or intervention (in the form of a web extension) that fundamentally alters our engagement with the Internet. The goal is to make a compelling site, app or extension with information, media, or other content but one that respects your user, plays with convention, or distorts a user's expectations on the web. You are a unique individual and your work is too! You may deconstruct your project or even the idea of a website itself. Perhaps your site is playful, mysterious, a game, a poem? How can the website be a work of art?

# Goals:
* the site should be responsive - it must work well on the desktop and mobile browsers
* the site should have interactive elements - you may want to use javascript, jquery or P5js
* the design should be compelling and unique - no cookie cutter sites. Question what the site is, the conventions of such sites, and make it your own!
* the site should be well-executed and original
* Consider how your site works with data and APIs.

**Final projects must be uploaded to the web by Wednesday May 8 at noon. Project presentations will be in class on May 8 at 3PM.** We will have a series of smaller steps to accomplish leading up to that.
